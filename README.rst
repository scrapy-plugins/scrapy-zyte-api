Scrapy plugin for `Zyte API`_.

.. _Zyte API: https://docs.zyte.com/zyte-api/get-started.html


Requirements
============

* Python 3.7+
* Scrapy 2.0.1+


Installation
============

.. code-block::

    pip install scrapy-zyte-api


Configuration
=============

To enable this plugin:

-   Set the ``http`` and ``https`` keys in the `DOWNLOAD_HANDLERS
    <https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/settings.html#std-setting-DOWNLOAD_HANDLERS>`_
    Scrapy setting to ``"scrapy_zyte_api.ScrapyZyteAPIDownloadHandler"``.

-   Add ``"scrapy_zyte_api.ScrapyZyteAPIDownloaderMiddleware"`` to the
    `DOWNLOADER_MIDDLEWARES
    <https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/settings.html#downloader-middlewares>`_
    Scrapy setting with any value, e.g. ``1000``.

-   Set the `REQUEST_FINGERPRINTER_CLASS
    <https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/request-response.html#request-fingerprinter-class>`_
    Scrapy setting to ``"scrapy_zyte_api.ScrapyZyteAPIRequestFingerprinter"``.

-   Set the `TWISTED_REACTOR
    <https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/settings.html#std-setting-TWISTED_REACTOR>`_
    Scrapy setting to
    ``"twisted.internet.asyncioreactor.AsyncioSelectorReactor"``.

-   Set `your Zyte API key
    <https://docs.zyte.com/zyte-api/usage/general.html#authorization>`_ as
    either the ``ZYTE_API_KEY`` Scrapy setting or as an environment variable of
    the same name.

For example, in the ``settings.py`` file of your Scrapy project:

.. code-block:: python

    DOWNLOAD_HANDLERS = {
        "http": "scrapy_zyte_api.ScrapyZyteAPIDownloadHandler",
        "https": "scrapy_zyte_api.ScrapyZyteAPIDownloadHandler",
    }
    DOWNLOADER_MIDDLEWARES = {
        "scrapy_zyte_api.ScrapyZyteAPIDownloaderMiddleware": 1000,
    }
    REQUEST_FINGERPRINTER_CLASS = "scrapy_zyte_api.ScrapyZyteAPIRequestFingerprinter"
    TWISTED_REACTOR = "twisted.internet.asyncioreactor.AsyncioSelectorReactor"
    ZYTE_API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY"

The ``ZYTE_API_ENABLED`` setting, which is ``True`` by default, can be set to
``False`` to disable this plugin.


Usage
=====

You can send requests through Zyte API in one of the following ways:

-   Send all request through Zyte API by default, letting Zyte API parameters
    be chosen automatically based on your Scrapy request parameters. See
    **Using transparent mode** below.

-   Send specific requests through Zyte API, setting all Zyte API parameters
    manually, keeping full control of what is sent to Zyte API. See **Sending
    requests with manually-defined parameters** below.

-   Send specific requests through Zyte API, letting Zyte API parameters be
    chosen automatically based on your Scrapy request parameters. See **Sending
    requests with automatically-mapped parameters** below.

Zyte API response parameters are mapped into Scrapy response parameters where
possible. See **Response mapping** below for details.


Using transparent mode
----------------------

Set the ``ZYTE_API_TRANSPARENT_MODE`` `Scrapy setting`_ to ``True`` to handle
Scrapy requests as follows:

.. _Scrapy setting: https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/settings.html

-   By default, requests are sent through Zyte API with automatically-mapped
    parameters. See **Sending requests with automatically-mapped parameters**
    below for details about automatic request parameter mapping.

    You do not need to set the ``zyte_api_automap`` request meta key to
    ``True``, but you can set it to a dictionary to extend your Zyte API
    request parameters.

-   Requests with the ``zyte_api`` request meta key set to a ``dict`` are sent
    through Zyte API with manually-defined parameters. See **Sending requests
    with manually-defined parameters** below.

-   Requests with the ``zyte_api_automap`` request meta key set to ``False``
    are *not* sent through Zyte API.

For example:

.. code-block:: python

    import scrapy


    class SampleQuotesSpider(scrapy.Spider):
        name = "sample_quotes"
        start_urls = ["https://quotes.toscrape.com/"]

        custom_settings = {
            "ZYTE_API_TRANSPARENT_MODE": True,
        }

        def parse(self, response):
            print(response.text)
            # "<html>…</html>"


Sending requests with manually-defined parameters
-------------------------------------------------

To send a Scrapy request through Zyte API with manually-defined parameters,
define your Zyte API parameters in the ``zyte_api`` key in
`Request.meta <https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/request-response.html#scrapy.http.Request.meta>`_
as a ``dict``.

The only exception is the ``url`` parameter, which should not be defined as a
Zyte API parameter. The value from ``Request.url`` is used automatically.

For example:

.. code-block:: python

    import scrapy


    class SampleQuotesSpider(scrapy.Spider):
        name = "sample_quotes"

        def start_requests(self):
            yield scrapy.Request(
                url="https://quotes.toscrape.com/",
                meta={
                    "zyte_api": {
                        "browserHtml": True,
                    }
                },
            )

        def parse(self, response):
            print(response.text)
            # "<html>…</html>"

Note that response headers are necessary for raw response decoding. When
defining parameters manually and requesting ``httpResponseBody`` extraction,
remember to also request ``httpResponseHeaders`` extraction:

.. code-block:: python

    import scrapy


    class SampleQuotesSpider(scrapy.Spider):
        name = "sample_quotes"

        def start_requests(self):
            yield scrapy.Request(
                url="https://quotes.toscrape.com/",
                meta={
                    "zyte_api": {
                        "httpResponseBody": True,
                        "httpResponseHeaders": True,
                    }
                },
            )

        def parse(self, response):
            print(response.text)
            # "<html>…</html>"

To learn more about Zyte API parameters, see the `data extraction usage`_ and
`API reference`_ pages of the `Zyte API documentation`_.

.. _API reference: https://docs.zyte.com/zyte-api/openapi.html
.. _data extraction usage: https://docs.zyte.com/zyte-api/usage/extract.html
.. _Zyte API documentation: https://docs.zyte.com/zyte-api/get-started.html


Sending requests with automatically-mapped parameters
-----------------------------------------------------

To send a Scrapy request through Zyte API letting Zyte API parameters be
automatically chosen based on the parameters of that Scrapy request, set the
``zyte_api_automap`` key in
`Request.meta <https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/request-response.html#scrapy.http.Request.meta>`_
to ``True``.

For example:

.. code-block:: python

    import scrapy


    class SampleQuotesSpider(scrapy.Spider):
        name = "sample_quotes"

        def start_requests(self):
            yield scrapy.Request(
                url="https://quotes.toscrape.com/",
                meta={
                    "zyte_api_automap": True,
                },
            )

        def parse(self, response):
            print(response.text)
            # "<html>…</html>"

See also **Using transparent mode** above and **Automated request parameter
mapping** below.


Response mapping
----------------

Zyte API responses are mapped with one of the following classes:

-   ``scrapy_zyte_api.responses.ZyteAPITextResponse``, a subclass of
    ``scrapy.http.TextResponse``, is used to map text responses, i.e. responses
    with ``browserHtml`` or responses with both ``httpResponseBody`` and
    ``httpResponseHeaders`` with a text body (e.g. plain text, HTML, JSON).

-   ``scrapy_zyte_api.responses.ZyteAPIResponse``, a subclass of
    ``scrapy.http.Response``, is used to map any other response.

Zyte API response parameters are mapped into response class attributes where
possible:

-   ``url`` becomes ``response.url``.

-   ``statusCode`` becomes ``response.status``.

-   ``httpResponseHeaders`` and ``experimental.responseCookies`` become
    ``response.headers``.

-   ``experimental.responseCookies`` is also mapped into the request cookiejar.

-   ``browserHtml`` and ``httpResponseBody`` are mapped into both
    ``response.text`` (``str``) and ``response.body`` (``bytes``).

    If none of these parameters were present, e.g. if the only requested output
    was ``screenshot``, ``response.text`` and ``response.body`` would be empty.

    If a future version of Zyte API supported requesting both outputs on the
    same request, and both parameters were present, ``browserHtml`` would be
    the one mapped into ``response.text`` and ``response.body``.

Both response classes have a ``raw_api_response`` attribute that contains a
``dict`` with the complete, raw response from Zyte API, where you can find all
Zyte API response parameters, including those that are not mapped into other
response class atttributes.

For example, for a request for ``httpResponseBody`` and
``httpResponseHeaders``, you would get:

.. code-block:: python

    def parse(self, response):
        print(response.url)
        # "https://quotes.toscrape.com/"
        print(response.status)
        # 200
        print(response.headers)
        # {b"Content-Type": [b"text/html"], …}
        print(response.text)
        # "<html>…</html>"
        print(response.body)
        # b"<html>…</html>"
        print(response.raw_api_response)
        # {
        #     "url": "https://quotes.toscrape.com/",
        #     "statusCode": 200,
        #     "httpResponseBody": "PGh0bWw+4oCmPC9odG1sPg==",
        #     "httpResponseHeaders": […],
        # }

For a request for ``screenshot``, on the other hand, the response would look
as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    def parse(self, response):
        print(response.url)
        # "https://quotes.toscrape.com/"
        print(response.status)
        # 200
        print(response.headers)
        # {}
        print(response.text)
        # ""
        print(response.body)
        # b""
        print(response.raw_api_response)
        # {
        #     "url": "https://quotes.toscrape.com/",
        #     "statusCode": 200,
        #     "screenshot": "iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUh…",
        # }
        from base64 import b64decode
        print(b64decode(response.raw_api_response["screenshot"]))
        # b'\x89PNG\r\n\x1a\n\x00\x00\x00\r…'


Automated request parameter mapping
-----------------------------------

When you enable automated request parameter mapping, be it through transparent
mode (see **Using transparent mode** above) or for a specific request (see
**Sending requests with automatically-mapped parameters** above), Zyte API
parameters are chosen as follows by default:

-   ``Request.url`` becomes ``url``, same as in requests with manually-defined
    parameters.

-   If ``Request.method`` is something other than ``"GET"``, it becomes
    ``httpRequestMethod``.

-   ``Request.headers`` become ``customHttpRequestHeaders``.

-   ``Request.body`` becomes ``httpRequestBody``.

-   If the ``ZYTE_API_EXPERIMENTAL_COOKIES_ENABLED`` Scrapy setting is
    ``True``, the COOKIES_ENABLED_ Scrapy setting is ``True`` (default), and
    provided request metadata does not set dont_merge_cookies_ to ``True``:

    .. _COOKIES_ENABLED: https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/downloader-middleware.html#std-setting-COOKIES_ENABLED
    .. _dont_merge_cookies: https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/request-response.html#std-reqmeta-dont_merge_cookies

    -   ``experimental.responseCookies`` is set to ``True``.

    -   Cookies from the request `cookie jar`_ become
        ``experimental.requestCookies``.

        .. _cookie jar: https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/downloader-middleware.html#std-reqmeta-cookiejar

        All cookies from the cookie jar are set, regardless of their cookie
        domain. This is because Zyte API requests may involve requests to
        different domains (e.g. when following cross-domain redirects, or
        during browser rendering).

        If the cookies to be set exceed the limit defined in the
        ``ZYTE_API_MAX_COOKIES`` setting (100 by default), a warning is logged,
        and only as many cookies as the limit allows are set for the target
        request. To silence this warning, set ``experimental.requestCookies``
        manually, e.g. to an empty dict. Alternatively, if Zyte API starts
        supporting more than 100 request cookies, update the
        ``ZYTE_API_MAX_COOKIES`` setting accordingly.

        If you are using a custom downloader middleware to handle request
        cookiejars, you can point the ``ZYTE_API_COOKIE_MIDDLEWARE`` setting to
        its import path to make scrapy-zyte-api work with it. The downloader
        middleware is expected to have a ``jars`` property with the same
        signature as in the built-in Scrapy downloader middleware for cookie
        handling.

-   ``httpResponseBody`` and ``httpResponseHeaders`` are set to ``True``.

    This is subject to change without prior notice in future versions of
    scrapy-zyte-api, so please account for the following:

    -   If you are requesting a binary resource, such as a PDF file or an
        image file, set ``httpResponseBody`` to ``True`` explicitly in your
        requests:

        .. code-block:: python

            Request(
                url="https://toscrape.com/img/zyte.png",
                meta={
                    "zyte_api_automap": {"httpResponseBody": True},
                },
            )

        In the future, we may stop setting ``httpResponseBody`` to ``True`` by
        default, and instead use a different, new Zyte API parameter that only
        works for non-binary responses (e.g. HMTL, JSON, plain text).

    -   If you need to access response headers, be it through
        ``response.headers`` or through
        ``response.raw_api_response["httpResponseHeaders"]``, set
        ``httpResponseHeaders`` to ``True`` explicitly in your requests:

        .. code-block:: python

            Request(
                url="https://toscrape.com/",
                meta={
                    "zyte_api_automap": {"httpResponseHeaders": True},
                },
            )

        At the moment we request response headers because some response headers
        are necessary to properly decode the response body as text. In the
        future, Zyte API may be able to handle this decoding automatically, so
        we would stop setting ``httpResponseHeaders`` to ``True`` by default.

For example, the following Scrapy request:

.. code-block:: python

    Request(
        method="POST"
        url="https://httpbin.org/anything",
        headers={"Content-Type": "application/json"},
        body=b'{"foo": "bar"}',
        cookies={"a": "b"},
    )

Results in a request to the Zyte API data extraction endpoint with the
following parameters:

.. code-block:: javascript

    {
        "customHttpRequestHeaders": [
            {
                "name": "Content-Type",
                "value": "application/json"
            }
        ],
        "experimental": {
            "requestCookies": [
                {
                    "name": "a",
                    "value": "b",
                    "domain": ""
                }
            ],
            "responseCookies": true
        },
        "httpResponseBody": true,
        "httpResponseHeaders": true,
        "httpRequestBody": "eyJmb28iOiAiYmFyIn0=",
        "httpRequestMethod": "POST",
        "url": "https://httpbin.org/anything"
    }

You may set the ``zyte_api_automap`` key in
`Request.meta <https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/request-response.html#scrapy.http.Request.meta>`_
to a ``dict`` of Zyte API parameters to extend or override choices made by
automated request parameter mapping.

Setting ``browserHtml`` or ``screenshot`` to ``True`` unsets
``httpResponseBody`` and ``httpResponseHeaders``, and makes ``Request.headers``
become ``requestHeaders`` instead of ``customHttpRequestHeaders``. For example,
the following Scrapy request:

.. code-block:: python

    Request(
        url="https://quotes.toscrape.com",
        headers={"Referer": "https://example.com/"},
        meta={"zyte_api_automap": {"browserHtml": True}},
    )

Results in a request to the Zyte API data extraction endpoint with the
following parameters:

.. code-block:: javascript

    {
        "browserHtml": true,
        "experimental": {
            "responseCookies": true
        },
        "requestHeaders": {"referer": "https://example.com/"},
        "url": "https://quotes.toscrape.com"
    }

When mapping headers, headers not supported by Zyte API are excluded from the
mapping by default. Use the following `Scrapy settings`_ to change which
headers are included or excluded from header mapping:

.. _Scrapy settings: https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/settings.html

-   ``ZYTE_API_SKIP_HEADERS`` determines headers that must *not* be mapped as
    ``customHttpRequestHeaders``, and its default value is:

    .. code-block:: python

       ["User-Agent"]

-   ``ZYTE_API_BROWSER_HEADERS`` determines headers that *can* be mapped as
    ``requestHeaders``. It is a ``dict``, where keys are header names and
    values are the key that represents them in ``requestHeaders``. Its default
    value is:

    .. code-block:: python

       {"Referer": "referer"}

To maximize support for potential future changes in Zyte API, automated
request parameter mapping allows some parameter values and parameter
combinations that Zyte API does not currently support, and may never support:

-   ``Request.method`` becomes ``httpRequestMethod`` even for unsupported_
    ``httpRequestMethod`` values, and even if ``httpResponseBody`` is unset.

    .. _unsupported: https://docs.zyte.com/zyte-api/usage/extract.html#zyte-api-set-method

-   You can set ``customHttpRequestHeaders`` or ``requestHeaders`` to ``True``
    to force their mapping from ``Request.headers`` in scenarios where they
    would not be mapped otherwise.

    Conversely, you can set ``customHttpRequestHeaders`` or ``requestHeaders``
    to ``False`` to prevent their mapping from ``Request.headers``.

-   ``Request.body`` becomes ``httpRequestBody`` even if ``httpResponseBody``
    is unset.

-   You can set ``httpResponseBody`` to ``False`` (which unsets the parameter),
    and not set ``browserHtml`` or ``screenshot`` to ``True``. In this case,
    ``Request.headers`` is mapped as ``requestHeaders``.

-   You can set ``httpResponseBody`` to ``True`` and also set ``browserHtml``
    or ``screenshot`` to ``True``. In this case, ``Request.headers`` is mapped
    both as ``customHttpRequestHeaders`` and as ``requestHeaders``, and
    ``browserHtml`` is used as the Scrapy response body.


Setting default parameters
==========================

Often the same configuration needs to be used for all Zyte API requests. For
example, all requests may need to set the same geolocation, or the spider only
uses ``browserHtml`` requests.

The following settings allow you to define Zyte API parameters to be included
in all requests:

-   ``ZYTE_API_DEFAULT_PARAMS`` is a ``dict`` of parameters to be combined with
    manually-defined parameters. See **Sending requests with manually-defined
    parameters** above.

    You may set the ``zyte_api`` request meta key to an empty ``dict`` to only
    use default parameters for that request.

-   ``ZYTE_API_AUTOMAP_PARAMS`` is a ``dict`` of parameters to be combined with
    automatically-mapped parameters. See **Sending requests with
    automatically-mapped parameters** above.

For example, if you set ``ZYTE_API_DEFAULT_PARAMS`` to
``{"geolocation": "US"}`` and ``zyte_api`` to ``{"browserHtml": True}``,
``{"url: "…", "geolocation": "US", "browserHtml": True}`` is sent to Zyte API.

Parameters in these settings are merged with request-specific parameters, with
request-specific parameters taking precedence.

``ZYTE_API_DEFAULT_PARAMS`` has no effect on requests that use automated
request parameter mapping, and ``ZYTE_API_AUTOMAP_PARAMS`` has no effect on
requests that use manually-defined parameters.

When using transparent mode (see **Using transparent mode** above), be careful
of which parameters you define through ``ZYTE_API_AUTOMAP_PARAMS``. In
transparent mode, all Scrapy requests go through Zyte API, even requests that
Scrapy sends automatically, such as those for ``robots.txt`` files when
ROBOTSTXT_OBEY_ is ``True``, or those for sitemaps when using a `sitemap
spider`_. Certain parameters, like ``browserHtml`` or ``screenshot``, are not
meant to be used for every single request.

.. _ROBOTSTXT_OBEY: https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/settings.html#robotstxt-obey
.. _sitemap spider: https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/spiders.html#sitemapspider


Customizing the retry policy
============================

API requests are retried automatically using the default retry policy of
`python-zyte-api`_.

API requests that exceed retries are dropped. You cannot manage API request
retries through Scrapy downloader middlewares.

Use the ``ZYTE_API_RETRY_POLICY`` setting or the ``zyte_api_retry_policy``
request meta key to override the default `python-zyte-api`_ retry policy with a
custom retry policy.

A custom retry policy must be an instance of `tenacity.AsyncRetrying`_.

Scrapy settings must be picklable, which `retry policies are not
<https://github.com/jd/tenacity/issues/147>`_, so you cannot assign retry
policy objects directly to the ``ZYTE_API_RETRY_POLICY`` setting, and must use
their import path string instead.

When setting a retry policy through request meta, you can assign the
``zyte_api_retry_policy`` request meta key either the retry policy object
itself or its import path string. If you need your requests to be serializable,
however, you may also need to use the import path string.

For example, to also retry HTTP 521 errors the same as HTTP 520 errors, you can
subclass RetryFactory_ as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    # project/retry_policies.py
    from tenacity import retry_if_exception, RetryCallState

Stats
=====

Stats from python-zyte-api_ are exposed as Scrapy stats with the
``scrapy-zyte-api`` prefix.


Request fingerprinting
======================

The request fingerprinter class of this plugin ensures that Scrapy 2.7 and
later generate unique `request fingerprints
<https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/request-response.html#request-fingerprints>`_
for Zyte API requests based on some of their parameters.

For example, a request for ``browserHtml`` and a request for ``screenshot``
with the same target URL are considered different requests. Similarly, requests
with the same target URL but different ``actions`` are also considered
different requests.

Zyte API parameters that affect request fingerprinting
------------------------------------------------------

The request fingerprinter class of this plugin generates request fingerprints
for Zyte API requests based on the following Zyte API parameters:

-   ``url`` (`canonicalized <https://w3lib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/w3lib.html#w3lib.url.canonicalize_url>`_)

    For URLs that include a URL fragment, like ``https://example.com#foo``, URL
    canonicalization keeps the URL fragment if ``browserHtml`` or
    ``screenshot`` are enabled.

-   Request attribute parameters (``httpRequestBody``,
    ``httpRequestMethod``)

-   Output parameters (``browserHtml``, ``httpResponseBody``,
    ``httpResponseHeaders``, ``screenshot``)

-   Rendering option parameters (``actions``, ``javascript``,
    ``screenshotOptions``)

-   ``geolocation``

The following Zyte API parameters are *not* taken into account for request
fingerprinting:

-   Request header parameters (``customHttpRequestHeaders``,
    ``requestHeaders``)

-   Metadata parameters (``echoData``, ``jobId``)

-   Experimental parameters (``experimental``)


Changing the fingerprinting of non-Zyte-API requests
----------------------------------------------------

You can assign a request fingerprinter class to the
``ZYTE_API_FALLBACK_REQUEST_FINGERPRINTER_CLASS`` Scrapy setting to configure
a custom request fingerprinter class to use for requests that do not go through
Zyte API:

.. code-block:: python

    ZYTE_API_FALLBACK_REQUEST_FINGERPRINTER_CLASS = "custom.RequestFingerprinter"

By default, requests that do not go through Zyte API use the default request
fingerprinter class of the installed Scrapy version.


Request fingerprinting before Scrapy 2.7
----------------------------------------

If you have a Scrapy version older than Scrapy 2.7, Zyte API parameters are not
taken into account for request fingerprinting. This can cause some Scrapy
components, like the filter of duplicate requests or the HTTP cache extension,
to interpret 2 different requests as being the same.

To avoid most issues, use automated request parameter mapping, either through
transparent mode or setting ``zyte_api_automap`` to ``True`` in
``Request.meta``, and then use ``Request`` attributes instead of
``Request.meta`` as much as possible. Unlike ``Request.meta``, ``Request``
attributes do affect request fingerprints in Scrapy versions older than Scrapy
2.7.

For requests that must have the same ``Request`` attributes but should still
be considered different, such as browser-based requests with different URL
fragments, you can set ``dont_filter`` to ``True`` on ``Request.meta`` to
prevent the duplicate filter of Scrapy to filter any of them out. For example:

.. code-block:: python

    yield Request(
        "https://toscrape.com#1",
        meta={"zyte_api_automap": {"browserHtml": True}},
        dont_filter=True,
    )
    yield Request(
        "https://toscrape.com#2",
        meta={"zyte_api_automap": {"browserHtml": True}},
        dont_filter=True,
    )

Note, however, that for other Scrapy components, like the HTTP cache
extensions, these 2 requests would still be considered identical.


Logging request parameters
==========================

Set the ``ZYTE_API_LOG_REQUESTS`` setting to ``True`` to enable the logging of
debug messages that indicate the JSON object sent on every extract request to
Zyte API.

For example::

   Sending Zyte API extract request: {"url": "https://example.com", "httpResponseBody": true}

The ``ZYTE_API_LOG_REQUESTS_TRUNCATE``, 64 by default, determines the maximum
length of any string value in the logged JSON object, excluding object keys. To
disable truncation, set it to 0.
